          WHY DEBACLES LIKE THE IOWA CAUCUS WILL KEEP HAPPENING

From the moment I saw the first headline blaming the Iowa caucus
reporting delay on a smartphone app, I knew what was coming: garbled,
contradictory bug reports from the field. Social media jammed with
toxic false rumors and deliberate spin bordering on disinformation.
News stories sourced from anonymous quotes that are more about score
settling than anything that happened in Iowa. And by the next day,
a mailbox full of questions from journalists with a familiar refrain:
from healthcare.gov to the latest debacle, why does this keep
happening?

There are answers. In fact, they are well known in some circles.
Most importantly, the government and political arenas share two
harmful cultural attitudes that contribute to repeated, avoidable
failures.

The greatest cultural problem was on display this week. When things
start to go wrong, everyone from the Twittersphere to reporters
scramble to find and blame a single cause: one mistake; one vendor;
one individual. This is both tactically useless in the moment and
strategically self-destructive in the long run.

In reality, when a system as complicated as the Iowa caucus breaks
down, it is the product of multiple minor failures, incidents, and
unexpected behaviors. Fixing it is like assembling a jigsaw puzzle
where 300 people each hold one piece. It is impossible to address
when everyone knows that whoever is found holding the "worst" piece
is going to become a scapegoat for the entire picture. This is why,
in government and politics, big failures are almost never followed
by big fixes.

Poor failure management has long-term corrosive effects as well.
Simple survivor bias means that leaders at too many of our most
important institutions are people that, having experienced failure,
have learned only one lesson, which is to dodge accountability.
After Iowa, as in past incidents, the individuals who just learned
much more meaningful (and expensive) lessons about how to build
reliable technology will leave and take their knowledge with them.

Other, more successful industries hold blameless problem resolution
as a core value. Aviation did not get safe enough for commercial
air travel until regulators and the industry learned to stop writing
down pilot error as the root cause of every crash. Thomas Watson,
former chairman of IBM, once famously said: "I was asked if I was
going to fire an employee who made a mistake that cost the company
$600,000. No, I replied, I just spent $600,000 training him."

A second problem endemic to government and politics is that our
large institutions do not understand that their core missions now
depend on new technology. If you spend time with the leaders of
old, large institutions, you will discover that many of them think
of the tech industry in 1980s stereotypes, of nerds that live in
the basement and can be paid in pizza and Mountain Dew. Worse,
thanks to the overwrought hero stories of 2008 and 2012, progressive
politics has an entrenched belief that all we will ever need,
tech-wise, is a couple of plucky volunteers to work miracles from
their garage for a few weeks. Convenient stereotypes feed leaders
natural fear of change and desire to maintain control, and the
result is that critical decisions about schedule, scope, and budget
for large tech projects are often made with no input from technical
experts.

There is a third factor that is particularly relevant in politics
on the Democratic side, which stems from a belief that good technology
comes from lone prodigies. Unlike the Republicans, the Democratic
establishment has no sustainable, built-to-last technical infrastructure
that receives reliable support from donors or party leaders. Instead,
we put misplaced faith in the market solving our infrastructure
needs, in the form of myriad shoestring operations competing for
tiny venture-capital-style seed grants and contracts from PACs and
campaigns. The money that flows to tech firms is a tiny fraction
of political spending, and it dries to nothing in the off-season.
The Clinton campaign hired a team of dozens to curate data and build
technology. Nearly all of them have left politics, taking their
knowledge and expertise with them. The same was true for most of
the entrepreneurs who, motivated by Trumps election, stepped into
the ring in 2017.

The real priority is in plain sight. Multiple organizations have
announced plans to spend hundreds of millions of dollars on ad
campaigns to fight Trump in 2020. Contrast that with the $60,000
budget and two-month timeline for an app to execute what may be the
most critical primary of the season.

Eventually, the media will likely conclude that the Iowa situation
was a perfect storm of uniquely incompetent people and unforeseeable,
one-off anomalies. The truth is that these storms are a product of
the climate we have constructed for ourselves. Until we change it,
spectacular civic tech flops will remain perfectly normal.
